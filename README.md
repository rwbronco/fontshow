# fontshow
Docker container for displaying fonts in a folder

This docker container uses php:apache, composer, and php-font-lib (https://github.com/dompdf/php-font-lib) to pull a list of fonts from a directory, cache the names of the fonts, and display them on a webpage where users can download them.
